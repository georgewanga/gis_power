Utilizing the geographic information system(GIS) in an electrical power distribution network by incorporating a geographical context in transformer distribution assets data and use of web interface display to illustrate the dynamic loading of power distribution in Nairobi South area.  Involved creation of a web interface that allows a user to build a dynamic system of power distribution assets; substations, transformers and power lines. The system stores the information for future planning and analysis such as load on a particular transformer. Using Django platform(a python web framework), QGIS and PostgreSQL, the data in the system was laid on the existing map of Kenya.   Online mapping and access of the electrical distribution network on a web map help in planning for new installations and expansions, maintenance and easy update and retrieval of records. Users can easily access the power distribution network assets information and client information using their internet- connected computers or mobile phones. The system is capable of restriction of the data available to different users, for instance, data accessible by the Engineer is not accessible by the technician.
